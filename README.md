#  Apple Stock Price – Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

This project focuses on performing end-to-end time series analysis and forecasting on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using Python and industry-standard statistical and machine learning techniques.

---

##  Problem Statement

Accurately forecasting stock prices is crucial for investors, portfolio managers, and financial institutions. This project addresses how past trends and seasonality in Apple's stock data can be used to build a reliable model for short-term forecasting.

---

##  Objectives

- Understand the structure of time series data.
- Explore Apple stock trends, volatility, and seasonality.
- Apply suitable forecasting models (e.g.,AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA).
- Evaluate model performance using statistical metrics.
- Highlight the impact of domain knowledge on time series modeling.

## Time Series Processing & Statistical Tests

To ensure that the Apple stock time series data was ready for modeling and forecasting, the following preprocessing techniques and tests were performed:

| Technique/Test                     | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Log Transformation**             | To stabilize the variance (heteroskedasticity) across the series.      |
| **Differencing**                   | To remove trends and make the series stationary.                       |
| **Detrending**                     | Removed deterministic trends using linear regression.                  |
| **Moving Average Smoothing**       | Smoothed short-term fluctuations and highlighted overall trends.       |
| **Seasonal Decomposition (Additive/Multiplicative)** | To isolate trend, seasonality, and residual components.       |
| **White Noise Check**              | Verified whether the residuals behaved like white noise (random noise).|
| **Random Walk Hypothesis Test**    | Checked if the stock followed a random walk (non-predictable pattern). |
| **ACF (Autocorrelation Function)** | To detect lags with significant correlation in time series.            |
| **PACF (Partial ACF)**             | To determine the order of AR terms in ARIMA models.                    |
| **Smoothing Techniques** (e.g., EWMA) | Reduced noise and visualized the true signal.                          |

These techniques helped in understanding the **underlying structure of the data** and ensured the **correct selection of forecasting models**.

##  Key Concepts Emphasized

- Importance of **domain knowledge**:
  - Models alone can't capture real-world impacts like earnings reports or interest rate hikes.
- Avoiding the **brute-force model testing** trap.
- Understanding why a model works before applying it.

---

##  Models Applied

| Model       | Purpose                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| ARIMA       | Captures trend + autocorrelation |
| SARIMA      | Handles both trend and seasonality |
| Facebook Prophet | Business-ready forecasts with trend/holiday components |

---

##  Results & Performance

- **Best Model**: SARIMA with tuned parameters  
- **Metrics Achieved**:
  - RMSE: ~2.14  
  - MAE: ~1.63  
  - R² Score: 0.89  

 **Key Improvements**:
- Stabilized variance using log transformation.
- Differenced time series to achieve stationarity.
- Performance boosted by integrating domain events like earnings reports.

---

##  Forecasting Output

- Forecasted next 30 days of closing prices.
- Plotted predicted vs actual prices with confidence intervals.
- Final forecast clearly shows Apple stock's near-future trend with seasonality captured.

---

##  Lessons Learned

- Time series forecasting is **not** a plug-and-play task.
- Domain knowledge is as important as model tuning.
- Seasonality and stationarity drive your model choice.

---

##  Business Relevance

-  **Use Case**: Helps financial analysts predict short-term price trends to inform trading decisions.
-  **Impact**: Better model interpretability allows smarter investment strategies and risk management.

---

##  Conclusion

This project showcases a full time series pipeline — from data sourcing to forecasting — with a strong focus on explainability, business relevance, and performance evaluation. It serves as a solid demonstration of time series expertise in a finance domain scenario.
